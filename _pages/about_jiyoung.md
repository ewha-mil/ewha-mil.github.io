I am an assistant professor of the Department of AI at Ewha Womans University. 
Before joining Ewha Womans University, I was a research scientist at NAVER AI Lab from Dec. 2021 to Feb. 2025. 
I received PhD from Yonsei University, advised by Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn. 
Previously, I interned at Adobe Research in 2021, working with Justin Salamon and Dingzeyu Li, and collaborated with Microsoft Research, working with Daniel McDuff in 2020.

I am broadly interested in multimodal learning & computer vision. Mostly, I am interested in audio-visual/vision-language models, generative modeling, and video understanding, but not limited to.
